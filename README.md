## Description
The Node.js README Generator is a command-line application that runs with Node.js and dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This application will prompt the user for their input to build sections such as the Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project and less time creating a good README.
